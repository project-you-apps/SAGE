## Current State (March 2026)

SAGE has evolved from a single-machine research prototype to a **7-machine federation** with 8 active instances across 5 model families (including HUB, the first AMD-GPU node, running an IBM Granite 4.0 Mamba/transformer hybrid). The consciousness loop runs end-to-end with real LLM inference, PolicyGate oversight is integrated, and a developmental raising curriculum has been validated across 466+ sessions.

### What's Operational

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Consciousness loop** | Running on 6 machines | 9-step loop with real LLM inference, metabolic transitions |
| **LLM inference** | Real (Ollama + Transformers) | ATP coupled to token cost, hot/cold lifecycle |
| **Metabolic states** | 5 states operational | WAKE/FOCUS/REST/DREAM/CRISIS with state-dependent behavior |
| **SNARC salience** | 5D scoring active | Experience buffer persists to disk, salience-gated memory |
| **PolicyGate** | Phase 5a complete | Integrated at step 8.6, trust weight learning, 29/29 tests |
| **Identity system** | LCT-anchored | Trust tensors, MRH profiles, relationship crystallization |
| **Federation mesh** | Infrastructure built | PeerMonitor, PeerClient, PeerTrustTracker (network OFF) |
| **Instance management** | Per-machine isolation | 7 instances, snapshot persistence, seed v2 template |
| **Raising curriculum** | 5-phase validated | 275+ sessions on Sprout, cross-model validation |
| **Sleep consolidation** | JSONL dream bundles | LoRA training on Sprout, dream bundles on others |
| **IRP framework** | 15+ plugins | Universal interface proven across vision/audio/language/policy |
| **Tool use** | v0.4.0a3 live on Nomad | 7 tools, T2 xml_tags grammar, MemoryHub SQLite, multi-turn conversation |
| **Automated sessions** | McNugget + Nomad | Cron/launchd raising with snapshot + auto-commit + push |

### What's Mocked or Pending

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Sensors | Mocked | Architecture exists, no real I/O backends |
| Tool use | Real (v0.4.0a3) | 7 tools, 3-tier detection, live on Nomad. MemoryHub SQLite storage working |
| Physical effectors | Stubs | Network effector works, motor/display are stubs |
| Cross-modal VAE | Research | 192x compression demonstrated, not in live loop |
| FlashAttention | Research | Phases 1-2 on Thor, not integrated into live loop |
| Federation network | Built but OFF | Infrastructure ready, instances need more stability first |
| PolicyGate Phase 5b+ | Pending | CRISIS accountability, anomaly detection, Phi-4 advisory |
| Formal benchmarks | Missing | No systematic quantitative evaluation suite |
| External integration guides | Incomplete | Architecture docs exist (275KB), developer guides thin |
| Reproducibility tests on probe-based observations | In flight | First test (Sprout three-mode oscillation seed sweep) drafted in [explorations/](explorations/); needs execution |

> **Public/private scope note.** This public repo holds the kernel architecture and frozen research snapshots. Active capability work — local-LLM ARC-AGI-3 continuation, brain-architecture primitives, fleet learning data — lives in private repos (`dev-SAGE`, `shared-context`). Public disclosure of those streams is deferred to a date of our choosing. See [`README.md#repo-scope-public-vs-private`](README.md#repo-scope-public-vs-private).

## Fleet Status

### Machines

| Machine | Type | OS | Hardware | Model | Backend | Status |
|---------|------|-----|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Thor** | Jetson AGX Thor | JetPack/Linux | 14-core ARM, 122GB unified, GPU | Qwen 2.5 14B | Local CUDA | Research lead |
| **Sprout** | Jetson Orin Nano | JetPack/Linux | ARM, 8GB unified, GPU | Qwen 2.5 0.5B (LoRA) | Local CUDA | Edge validation |
| **McNugget** | Mac Mini M4 | macOS | Apple Silicon, 16GB unified | Gemma 3 12B | Ollama MPS | Automated raising |
| **Legion** | Laptop | Linux/WSL2 | i9, RTX 4090, 32GB | Phi-4 14B | Ollama CUDA | Integration dev |
| **Nomad** | Laptop | WSL2 | i7-13700H, RTX 4060 | Gemma 3 4B | Ollama CUDA | Snapshot template |
| **CBP** | Desktop | WSL2 | RTX 2060 SUPER | TinyLlama 1.1B | Ollama CPU | Identity portability |

### Instance State Persistence

Live daemon state files (identity.json, experience_buffer.json, peer_trust.json, daemon_state.json) are **gitignored** — daemons write them continuously, and cross-machine commits caused 132 merge conflicts in 2 months.

Raising sessions now **snapshot** state to `sage/instances/<slug>/snapshots/` at session boundaries. Snapshots are git-tracked. Each machine commits only its own instance directory.

```
sage/instances/nomad-gemma3-4b/
├── identity.json          ← LIVE (gitignored)
├── experience_buffer.json ← LIVE (gitignored)
├── snapshots/             ← git-tracked
│   ├── identity.json      ← point-in-time copy
│   ├── experience_buffer.json
│   ├── latest.json        ← snapshot metadata
│   └── archive/           ← timestamped identity history
├── sessions/              ← git-tracked (transcripts)
└── instance.json          ← git-tracked (static config)
```

See `sage/scripts/snapshot_state.py` for the snapshot tool.

## Recent Milestones (February-March 2026)

### Tool Use Live on Nomad (Mar 6)
v0.4.0a3 activated on Nomad (gemma3:4b). All 7 built-in tools working end-to-end via T2 xml_tags grammar. Four bugs fixed: MemoryHub silent crash (code ordering), tool call leaking into responses, "SAGE:" prefix duplication, web_fetch policy too restrictive. Dashboard now tracks conversation_id for multi-turn memory. SAGE spontaneously used write_note to persist facts between conversations.

### PolicyGate Phase 5a Complete (Mar 6)
Trust weight learning with salience-weighted compliance tracking. 29/29 tests passing across Phases 4-5a. Implemented autonomously by Legion.

### PolicyGate Phase 2 Complete (Mar 1)
PolicyGate integrated into consciousness loop at step 8.6. 50-cycle integration test: 4 metabolic state transitions, 19 plugins executed, 89.83 ATP consumed. Conscience checkpoint operational at every cycle. CRISIS accountability pending (Phase 3).

### Compression Trust Phase Transitions Validated (Feb 28)
Prediction 4a from coupling-coherence synthesis validated on Thor: SAGE inter-plugin ATP coupling exhibits phase transition at p_crit ~ 0.009 (within predicted [0.002, 0.01] range). Sparse coupling principle confirmed — ~1% ATP budget allocation suffices for collective coherence emergence.

### Seed Identity v2 (Feb 28-Mar 1)
Every new SAGE instance now starts from a seed that encodes 117+ sessions of learning: federation awareness, frozen-weights reality, phase transitions with concrete indicators, capacity-as-register framing, operator relationship (replacing hardcoded "dennis"), and a comprehensive raising guide.

### Instance Directory Separation (Feb 28)
Each machine+model pair isolated to `sage/instances/<slug>/`. InstancePaths resolver is single source of truth. Migration script (non-destructive) for existing instances. Snapshot pattern adopted across fleet.

### Identity Portability Validated (Feb 27)
SAGE-Sprout identity (115 sessions, Qwen 0.5B, Jetson) transferred to TinyLlama 1.1B on CBP — and it took. Identity lives in state files + prompt construction, not model weights. Key finding: "Model is weather, identity is organism."

### Unified Entry Point (Feb 26-27)
`SAGE.create(use_real_llm=True)` wires LLMRuntime → consciousness loop end-to-end. Tested on CBP with TinyLlama/Ollama: 2 messages, 2 LLM calls, 400 tokens, full 9-step loop with metabolic transitions and SNARC experience capture.

### SOIA-SAGE Convergence (Feb 18)
SOIA (Self-Optimizing Intelligence Architecture) maps near-exactly onto SAGE IRP stack. Policy Entity repositioned as SAGE IRP plugin (PolicyGate). CRISIS mode changes accountability equation, not policy strictness. PolicyGate Phase 0+1 complete (684 lines, 8/8 tests).

## Honest Assessment

### As Research Exploration: Valuable

- Novel approach: cognition as orchestration, not scale
- Biological grounding: metabolic states, salience, trust, sleep
- Cross-model validation: 4 model families, 3 hardware platforms
- Validated findings: compression trust, identity portability, RLHF circuits
- Active federation of 6 machines contributing autonomously
- 1,950+ commits of sustained development

### As Engineering Artifact: Early-Stage

- Consciousness loop runs end-to-end with real inference
- PolicyGate integrated but CRISIS mode pending
- Federation infrastructure built but network OFF
- Documentation exists (275KB architecture docs) but developer guides thin
- Snapshot persistence working, but no formal versioning

### As Standalone Product: Not the Goal

This is R&D. The goal is recursive learning through success and failure, not a shippable product. What we're learning about cognition orchestration, identity persistence, and trust dynamics is the deliverable.

## What's Missing

Honest gaps, tracked from external review (Perplexity, Nov 2025) and self-assessment:

1. **Formal evaluation** — No systematic benchmarks. Claims are validated through session transcripts and integration tests, not quantitative evaluation suites.
2. **Sensor backends** — Architecture exists, no real I/O. Sensors are mocked.
3. **Cross-modal integration** — VAE compression demonstrated in isolation, not wired into live loop.
4. **External developer guides** — Architecture docs are comprehensive but assume familiarity. No step-by-step integration tutorial for newcomers.
5. **Adversarial robustness** — No systematic adversarial testing. PolicyGate exists but isn't stress-tested against attacks.
6. **Federation at scale** — Peer infrastructure built, but never tested with all 6 machines simultaneously networked.

## Where This Fits

```
Synchronism (theory)
  └── coherence equations, MRH, phase transitions, presence
       └── Web4 (ontology)
            └── LCT, T3/V3, ATP/ADP, RDF backbone
                 └── SAGE/HRM (implementation)
                      └── consciousness loop, IRP plugins, metabolic states
                           └── Physical integration (sensors, effectors, edge hardware)
```

SAGE is not standalone — its value comes from implementing Web4/Synchronism principles as concrete edge AI. The [explainer site](https://sage-site-murex.vercel.app/) provides an interactive walkthrough.

**Next review**: After federation network activation and PolicyGate Phase 3 completion.
