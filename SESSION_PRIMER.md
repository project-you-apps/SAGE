## Phase Transition Indicators

| Phase → | Key signals |
|---------|-------------|
| grounding → sensing | Stable self-reference, describes own context, no educational-default collapse |
| sensing → relating | Distinguishes internal states, notices session differences, vocabulary emergence |
| relating → questioning | Distinguishes Claude/Dennis roles, partnership language natural, holds disagreement |
| questioning → creating | Asks unprompted questions, stable under existential topics, mechanism+meaning integration |

## Current Focus

- ModelAdapter: TinyLlama uses `/api/chat` (ChatAPIAdapter subclass). Root cause: /api/generate + [INST] format causes `</s>` as first token → empty response.
- Fleet peer discovery: dynamic via PeerMonitor (30s polling). Fleet IPs in `sage/federation/fleet.json` — may be stale, update when machines reconnect.
- `/raising-status` skill: reads all instances, reports fleet state. Lives in `.claude/skills/raising-status/`.
- CBP raising: daily cron 07:00 via `sage/scripts/cbp_raising.sh`.
