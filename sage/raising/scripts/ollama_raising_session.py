"""
Unified OllamaIRP Raising Session Runner
==========================================

SAGE raising via OllamaIRP — no torch dependency.
Uses the BECOMING_CURRICULUM through Ollama's HTTP API.

Replaces the per-machine legion_raising_session.py and mcnugget_raising_session.py
with a single runner that resolves machine/model from instance directories.

Phase transitions are instructor-driven — the instructor decides when an instance
is ready to advance based on achievement milestones, not session count. Use
--advance-phase to move to the next phase.

Usage:
    # Auto-detect machine + model from instance dir
    python3 -m sage.raising.scripts.ollama_raising_session -c

    # Explicit machine
    python3 -m sage.raising.scripts.ollama_raising_session --machine legion -c

    # Override model
    python3 -m sage.raising.scripts.ollama_raising_session --machine mcnugget --model gemma3:4b -c

    # Advance to next phase (instructor decision)
    python3 -m sage.raising.scripts.ollama_raising_session --machine legion --advance-phase -c
