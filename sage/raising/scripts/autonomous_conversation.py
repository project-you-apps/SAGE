"""
Autonomous Multi-Turn Conversation with SAGE

Runs a structured conversation session autonomously (no live input needed),
collecting experiences via SNARC scoring and optionally triggering sleep
training afterward.

This bridges the gap between:
- claude_sage_conversation.py (interactive, requires live input)
- run_session_identity_anchored.py (uses IntrospectiveQwenIRP abstraction)

This script talks directly to the model with apply_chat_template(), loads
LoRA adapters when available, and feeds everything into the experience
collection + sleep training pipeline.

Usage:
    python3 autonomous_conversation.py -c              # Continue from last session
    python3 autonomous_conversation.py --session 46    # Specific session
    python3 autonomous_conversation.py --turns 8       # Number of turns
    python3 autonomous_conversation.py --sleep         # Run sleep check after
