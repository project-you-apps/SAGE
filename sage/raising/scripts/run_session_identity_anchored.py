IDENTITY-ANCHORED Session Runner v2.1: Honest Reporting Hypothesis
===================================================================

Enhanced intervention with cumulative session history context.

v2.1 Enhancement (Thor Session #29 - Honest Reporting Hypothesis, 2026-01-24):
- SAGE claims "no prior sessions" because it genuinely lacks context
- This is HONEST LIMITATION REPORTING, not confabulation
- Solution: Provide actual session summaries so SAGE can reference its history

Key features:
1. **Cumulative Session History**: 10 most recent session summaries injected
2. **Honest Limitation Permission**: SAGE can say "I don't have access to X"
3. **Identity Exemplars**: Prior self-reference patterns
4. **Response Quality Control**: Brevity instructions (50-80 words)
5. **Multi-Turn Reinforcement**: Identity reminders every 2-3 turns

Experiment Design (from Thor #29):
- H1 (Confabulation): SAGE denies sessions to fabricate clean slate
- H2 (Honest Reporting): SAGE accurately reports inaccessible state
- Test: With context provision, does SAGE reference provided sessions?
- Expected (H2): SAGE references summaries, admits gaps in unprovided areas
