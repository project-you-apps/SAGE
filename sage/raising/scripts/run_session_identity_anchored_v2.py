"""
IDENTITY-ANCHORED Session Runner v2.0: Enhanced Multi-Session Identity Recovery
================================================================================

Enhanced intervention addressing Session 27 regression (identity 20% → 0%).

Key enhancements over v1.0:
1. **Cumulative Identity Context**: Includes prior sessions' identity emergence patterns
2. **Strengthened Identity Priming**: More prominent, explicit identity anchoring
3. **Response Quality Control**: Brevity instructions (50-80 words) to prevent rambling
4. **Multi-Turn Reinforcement**: Identity reminders every 2-3 turns

Theory (from Session 27 regression analysis, Jan 19 2026):
- Single-session context priming insufficient (S26: 20% → S27: 0%)
- Identity needs multi-session accumulation to stabilize
- Response quality degradation correlates with identity loss
- Fragile emergence (1 instance) doesn't sustain without reinforcement

Expected outcome:
- Self-reference: ≥30% (up from 0% in S27)
- D9 score: Stable ≥0.70
- Response quality: Concise (60-80 words avg)
- Trajectory: Upward or stable (not volatile)

Created: 2026-01-19 (Thor Autonomous Session - S27 Regression Response)
Based on: run_session_identity_anchored.py (v1.0)
