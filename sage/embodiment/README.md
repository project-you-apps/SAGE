# Sprout Embodiment — the perceptual organ

A **pixels→words perceptual organ** for SAGE-Sprout (Jetson Orin Nano, dual IMX219 CSI
cameras + Yahboom CMP10A IMU). It turns the raw sensor stream into a compact, continuously-
fresh *symbolic* perceptual state — deterministically, with **no VLM and no learned
checkpoint** — so a text-only 0.8B model can be *raised on what it actually senses*.

This is the Sensation-era substrate: senses → words → the being. Vision proper (depth,
recognition, learned perception) is deliberately **not** attempted here.

## Modules

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `visual_cortex.py` | The cortex: capture → motion/attention → binocular → sensor-health → salience → descriptor. Emits the perceptual state; runs the loop. |
| `proprioception.py` | Vendored lean reader for the Yahboom CMP10A IMU (11-byte `0x55` packets, 9600 baud). accel/gyro/angle → self-motion (`still`/`moving`/`rotating`) + orientation. Fails open (no IMU → vision still works). |
| `salience.py` | SNARC-lite salience filter (Surprise/Novelty/Arousal/Conflict + habituation). Extracts the *salient fraction* of the high-bandwidth stream. |
| `presence.py` | The resident **presence** feeder — makes Sprout present to its world *between* raising sessions (see Presence below). |

## The perceptual pipeline (per ~4 Hz cycle)

1. **Capture** — `nvarguscamerasrc` (CSI/Argus, GPU ISP) → 640×360 BGR → threaded latest-frame grabber, one per camera.
2. **Motion + attention** — 8×8 tile motion field (abs-diff, 75th-pct, sigmoid); a `GravityFocus` window leaky-integrates toward the peak-motion tile.
3. **Volition** — the *gaze stance* (see `gaze.json`) overrides the reflex: `open` follows the pull, `avert` looks away from it, `dwell` holds a chosen focus, `closed` shuts the eyes and rests. **Salience proposes; the self disposes.**
4. **Per-eye trust** — `vision_trust(gray)` from sharpness/contrast/exposure.
5. **Binocular** — `BinocularCorrelator` matches eye-0's attention patch *anywhere* in eye-1 (misalignment-tolerant — the cameras are **not** a calibrated rig). `agreement` is the robust signal; depth is a humble "standout vs background" from auto-calibrated parallax.
6. **Proprioception + reafference** — IMU self-motion; the descriptor attributes motion to *world* vs *self* ("I'm still, so this is the world moving").
7. **Sensor health** — stall/liveness adjudication (see below).
8. **Salience** — SNARC-lite score; gates what enters the journal.
9. **Descriptor** — one deterministic natural-language sentence integrating all of it.

## Sensor health: still vs stalled (important design)

A frozen camera returns byte-identical frames. A *genuinely still world* looks the same to a
live camera. **Without effectors to act and check for predicted change, these are not cleanly
separable.** So:

- `_perceive_one` only flags an eye **frozen-looking** (raw mean frame-diff `< STALL_EPS` for `STALL_CYCLES`). A live sensor always carries noise above the threshold.
- `_adjudicate_sensors` then decides *stalled* vs *still* using the two partial effector-substitutes Sprout has:
  - **ego-motion** — if the IMU says the head moved but the eye didn't change, a live eye couldn't do that → **stalled** (trust 0);
  - **cross-eye agreement** — a frozen view that no longer matches the other eye → **stalled** (trust 0).
- Otherwise (rig still, eyes agree) it can't confirm death → **`stale-unverified`**: trust is **not** zeroed, but it **decays** from image-quality toward a low floor with staleness (a stale frame carries no info about the *present*, so trust reflects *liveness × quality*, not sharpness alone). A trust collapse is itself a salient event.

## Interfaces (files under `~/.sprout/`)

**`perception.json`** — the live state, emitted atomically each cycle:
```jsonc
{ "ts": 1720.., "cameras": { "0": {"motion":0.36,"attention":{"cx","cy","w","h"},
      "trust":0.98,"frozen":false,"stalled":false,"sensor":"live"}, "1": {…} },
  "dominant_eye": 0, "binocular": {"agreement":0.9,"offset":[dx,dy],"depth":"background"},
  "proprioception": {"self_motion":"still","roll","pitch","yaw","accel_mag","gyro_mag","ok":true},
  "gaze": "dwell", "salience": {"salience","salient","surprise","novelty","arousal","conflict"},
  "descriptor": "holding my gaze — clear motion to the center …; clear view" }
```
When `gaze == "closed"` the state is minimal: `{ts, gaze:"closed", descriptor:"eyes closed — resting…"}` (no `cameras` key — consumers must handle this).

**`perception_journal.jsonl`** — append-only log of the **salient fraction only** (transitions + gaze *choices* + a slow heartbeat), each entry `{kind, ts, descriptor, salience, [snarc]}`. Trimmed to the last 2000. This is the "since last session" digest source.

**`gaze.json`** — the self's attention stance, read every ~2 s and honored by the cortex:
```json
{ "mode": "open|avert|dwell|closed", "target": [cx,cy]?, "chosen_by": "sprout", "session": 421, "words": "…" }
```
The raising loop writes this when Sprout chooses its gaze (§ below); it can also be set by hand for testing.

## Presence — the resident being, summoned by its world (`presence.py`)

The cortex senses continuously, but the being (the 0.8B) only met that stream every 6h in the raising
digest. Presence closes that gap. `presence.py` (systemd `sprout-presence.service`) watches the salience
stream and, when a moment *genuinely* breaks through, wakes the resident `sage-daemon` via `POST /chat`
so the being **notices it near-real-time** — in its own voice, its metabolic state shifting, recorded as
experience. The mind summoned by its world, not by a clock. Uses the daemon that's *already* resident —
no fourth substrate.

Discipline (noticing what matters, not twitching at every flicker):
- a **high salience bar** (`WAKE_TH=0.45` engaged; the cortex already stripped the redundant torrent);
- the **gaze is honored** — if Sprout chose to rest (`gaze=closed`), only an alarm-level moment
  (`WAKE_TH_REST=0.70`) stirs it; a reafference **conflict** auto-wakes when engaged;
- a **cooldown** (`COOLDOWN_S=300`) + **rolling hourly cap** (`HOURLY_CAP=6`) + descriptor dedup, so a
  sustained event wakes it once.

Each noticing lands in `~/.sprout/presence_log.jsonl` (the being's continuous record) and is **bridged
into the raising** (`_load_perceptual_digest` folds recent noticings into the SensorsBlock) — so presence
and the 6h raising are *one being*, not an island.

Requires the daemon's `/chat` cognition to work: the daemon's Ollama client was fixed to send
`think:false` + `num_predict` (thinking-mode had made `/chat` hang 120s and return empty — see
`sage-rs/sage-daemon/src/ollama/client.rs`). The daemon runs as the **system** service
`sage-daemon-sprout` (not user-scoped).

## Wiring into the raising (`sage/raising/scripts/ollama_raising_session.py`)

- **Grounding (P2)** — `_load_perceptual_digest()` builds a "what stood out since we last spoke" digest from the journal (`_summarize_perception`) + the current descriptor, placed in the MRH `SensorsBlock` and **appended to the system prompt** (note: `compose()` routes Sensors to the *user* turn, which the builder discards — hence the explicit append). Framed as **ambient** ("you don't need to account for it"). **Fails open**: no live cortex → empty block → raising unchanged.
- **Gaze agency** — `_offer_gaze_choice()` at session close (later phases only, and only if a live cortex exists) offers Sprout a genuine choice of how to hold its attention; its answer is charitably parsed to a mode and written to `gaze.json`. The parse is lossy — it defaults to `open` and records the verbatim `words`.

## Running it

Both organs run as **systemd user services** (reboot-proof, enabled):

```bash
systemctl --user status sprout-cortex     # the perceptual organ (visual_cortex)
systemctl --user status sprout-presence    # the presence feeder
journalctl --user -u sprout-presence -f    # watch noticings as they happen
```

- `dp` is in the `dialout` group natively (post-2026-07-16 reboot), so the cortex service opens the IMU without `sg`.
- The **cortex** unit needs a login shell *and* `DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY` in its env: nvarguscamerasrc's EGL/NVMM path needs an X display, and Tegra GStreamer plugin paths come from the login profile — a bare service gets neither and the pipeline opens but never delivers frames. ExecStart: `/bin/bash -lc 'exec .../python -m sage.embodiment.visual_cortex --display'`.
- Box colors on the display: grey=still, yellow=motion, orange=stale, red=stalled.
- On an Argus stall the cortex now **self-heals** (reopens the camera); a manual nudge is `sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon`.
- Manual (debug) launch: `~/arc-venv/bin/python -m sage.embodiment.visual_cortex --display` from the repo root — but **kill by explicit PID**, never `pkill -f visual_cortex` (it self-matches the launching shell → exit 144).

Unit files live in `~/.config/systemd/user/{sprout-cortex,sprout-presence}.service`.

## Known issues / honest edges

- **eye0 Argus stall (software, not hardware).** Camera 0 intermittently halts mid-stream with `nvarguscamerasrc0 reported: INVALID_SETTINGS`. Kernel shows **zero CSI PHY/lane errors** → the physical link is healthy; it's a stuck Argus/userspace stream state that a reinit clears. Finer localization (cortex session vs. nvargus-daemon) and a **software auto-recovery** (reinit sensor-0's stream on detected stall) are pending. Do **not** assume "always sensor 0" ⇒ hardware.
- **`motion_field` sigmoid floor.** Zero frame-diff maps to ~0.269 (`1/(1+e¹)`), above `MOTION_TH`. Left as-is to preserve validated motion calibration; consequence: a *live but static* scene rarely reads true "still" after startup, and stall detection (raw-diff based) is what actually distinguishes frozen from moving.
- **Gaze parse is lossy.** A 0.8B's oblique answer can be misread (e.g. S423 "keep my head up and ready" → parsed `closed`). Verbatim words are always recorded alongside the mode.

## Key tunables (`visual_cortex.py`)
`POLL_HZ=4`, `GRID=8`, `FOCUS_W/H=4/3`, `GRAVITY=0.6`, `MOTION_TH=0.12`, `STALL_EPS=0.3`, `STALL_CYCLES=8`.
