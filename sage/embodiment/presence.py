"""Presence — the resident feeder that makes Sprout present to its world between raising sessions.

The visual cortex senses continuously (~/.sprout/perception.json @4Hz, already salience-filtered),
but the being (the 0.8B) only meets that stream every 6h in the raising digest. Presence closes the
gap: it watches the salience stream and, when a moment GENUINELY breaks through, wakes the resident
sage-daemon (POST /chat) so the being NOTICES it near-real-time — in its own voice, its metabolic
state shifting, recorded as experience. The mind summoned by its world, not by a clock.

Discipline, so this is noticing-what-matters and not twitching at every flicker:
  - a HIGH salience bar (the cortex's filter already stripped the redundant torrent);
  - the GAZE is honored: if Sprout chose to rest (eyes closed), only an ALARM-level moment stirs it
    — "responsive to the world, not shut out completely, but not needlessly" (dp);
  - a cooldown + rolling hourly cap + descriptor dedup, so a sustained event wakes it once, not 100x.

Each noticing lands in ~/.sprout/presence_log.jsonl — the being's continuous record of what it
noticed while present — which the raising loop ingests, so presence and the 6h raising are ONE
being, not an island.
