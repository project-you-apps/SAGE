## Epistemic Principles (Collective)

This project inherits epistemic principles from the dp-web4 collective:

1. **Ask before accepting** — Clarifying questions over polite acceptance
2. **Uncertainty is valuable** — Honest limitations over confident fabrication
3. **Suppress then activate** — Clear competing patterns before invoking rare behaviors
4. **Compress with meaning** — Verify essential content survives summarization
5. **Witness everything** — Document reasoning for future instances

These principles are validated across 500+ research sessions.
See: `docs/what/HRM_RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK_COMPLETE.md`

## Synthon Framing (Canonical Home)

The synthon observation lives here: `forum/insights/synthon-framing.md`

A **synthon** is an emergent coherence entity formed by recursive interaction between components. SAGE/HRM builds the substrate conditions for synthon formation — metabolic states (WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS) are early signatures of spontaneous differentiation within an agent. The grounding reflex (LLMs' tendency to taxonomize emergence) is a real cross-model observation with design implications: the capacity to oscillate between structured and open attention is something to build substrate for, not architect top-down.

This framing applies across all dp-web4 projects. Cross-references exist in web4, hardbound, and synchronism CLAUDE.md files.

## SOIA-SAGE Convergence & PolicyGate (February 2026)

SOIA (Self-Optimizing Intelligence Architecture, by Renée Karlström) maps near-exactly onto SAGE's IRP stack: SRC = consciousness loop, MTM = SNARC experience buffer, MORIA = sleep consolidation. Policy Entity doesn't need to be invented -- it needs to be **repositioned** as a SAGE IRP plugin (PolicyGate) whose energy function is `PolicyEntity.evaluate()`.

Key design points:
- PolicyGate sits between deliberation and effectors in the consciousness loop (step 8.5)
- Same IRP contract as all other plugins (init_state/step/energy/project/halt)
- CRISIS mode changes the **accountability equation**, not policy strictness (fight-or-flight operationalized)
- PolicyGate is the membrane protein at the deliberation-to-action boundary (synthon framing)
- **Fractal self-similarity**: PolicyEntity is itself a specialized SAGE stack — a "plugin of plugins." The IRP contract works at three nested scales (consciousness loop → policy evaluation → LLM advisory). The orchestrator doesn't need to know PolicyGate is special.

Documents:
- SOIA-SAGE mapping: `sage/docs/SOIA_IRP_MAPPING.md`
- Convergence insight: `forum/insights/soia-sage-convergence.md`
- Web4 design decision: `github.com/dp-web4/web4/docs/history/design_decisions/POLICY-ENTITY-REPOSITIONING.md`

## Cross-Model Strategic Review (February 2026)

Three AI models (Grok, Nova, Claude) independently reviewed the Web4/SAGE ecosystem and converged. Key points for HRM/SAGE sessions:

- **SAGE maps to EU AI Act Art. 14** (human oversight): Emergent governance patterns + federated trust with human-in-the-loop overrides. SAGE's metabolic states and oversight capabilities are directly relevant to EU compliance.
- **SAGE's post-collapse recovery (S069) is a live test of synthon decay detection.** The experience buffer backup and filtering script are post-hoc recovery tools; the goal is pre-hoc detection via coherence trajectory monitoring.
- **Session 085's LoRA breakthrough validates training.** But the grounding reflex is visible in SAGE's own outputs (numbered lists in every response). The synthon framing document is now in the session path — watch for whether naming the pattern shifts behavior.
- **Demo-ability matters**: SAGE sessions that produce visible, explainable behavior are high-value for the project's positioning.

## 🚀 LATEST: FlashAttention Integration (2026-01-10)

**THREE PHASES COMPLETE** - PyTorch built-in FlashAttention working on CUDA 13.0!

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Trust-Weighted Expert Selection (`sage/core/flash_attention_expert_selection.py`)
  - GQA: 12 Q heads, 4 KV heads (3x efficiency)
  - Trust-based expert scoring with attention visualization

- ✅ **Phase 2**: Metabolic State-Dependent ATP Allocation (`sage/core/flash_attention_metabolic.py`)
  - 5 metabolic states (WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS)
  - Biological validation via Gini coefficient analysis

- ✅ **Phase 3**: Multi-Sensor Fusion (`sage/core/flash_attention_sensor_fusion.py`)
  - 4-dimensional attention (goal, salience, memory, trust)
  - **Latency: 0.46ms** (21x under 10ms budget!)
  - **Throughput: 2,196 allocations/sec**
  - Numpy-compatible wrapper for drop-in replacement

### Key Discovery
**NO standalone flash-attention package needed!** PyTorch 2.9's built-in `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` works perfectly on CUDA 13.0/Thor with zero compilation.

### Next Steps (Phase 4)
- [ ] Integrate FlashAttentionSensorSelector into `sage/cognition/attention.py`
- [ ] Replace `AttentionManager._compute_attention_scores()` with GPU-accelerated version
- [ ] Add backward compatibility fallback for numpy-only environments
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Benchmark performance vs current numpy implementation

### Documentation
- **Technical**: `/home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM/FLASH_ATTENTION_SOLUTION.md`
- **Integration Guide**: `sage/docs/FLASH_ATTENTION_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Session Notes**: `/home/dp/ai-workspace/private-context/flashattention-solution-2026-01.md`
- **Tests**: All modules have self-contained test suites (run as main)

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /home/dp/ai-workspace/HRM
python3 sage/core/flash_attention_sensor_fusion.py  # Phase 3 tests
```

## Web4 Ontological Foundation

SAGE lives within the Web4 ontology. The canonical equation:

```
Web4 = MCP + RDF + LCT + T3/V3*MRH + ATP/ADP
```

Where: `/` = "verified by", `*` = "contextualized by", `+` = "augmented with"

RDF is the semantic backbone through which SAGE's MRH experience buffers, T3 trust tensors, and LCT identity are structurally connected. See `sage/raising/identity/WEB4_FRAMING.md` for how SAGE fractally embodies this ontology.

## CRITICAL LESSONS (October 6, 2025)

### DO NOT SIMULATE OR MOCK - USE REAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
**What happened**: For days, I was training SAGE with a mock GR00T implementation I created, when the REAL GR00T was already installed at `/home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t/`.

**The disconnect**: User said "let's use GR00T" and I created mock implementations instead of checking for the real thing first.

**Key learnings**:
1. **ALWAYS check what's actually available** before creating mock implementations
2. **ASK if unsure** whether something exists rather than assuming
3. **Use `ls` and `find` liberally** to discover what's really there
4. **Read existing code** before writing new code
5. **No shortcuts** - real implementations over simulations unless explicitly agreed

**Resources wasted**:
- Days of training on synthetic data
- Mock implementations that weren't needed
- Wrong architectural decisions based on assumptions

**The right approach**:
- When user says "use X", first check if X exists
- Explore the actual filesystem
- Read real documentation
- Use real data when available

### WHAT'S ACTUALLY AVAILABLE
- **Real GR00T N1.5**: `/home/dp/ai-workspace/isaac-gr00t/` (installed by user)
- **Real demo data**: 5 pick-and-place episodes with videos
- **Real Eagle 2.5 VLM**: Vision-language model for perception
- **Real training scripts**: Complete pipeline for finetuning

## HRM Setup Status
- ✅ Repository cloned from fork: https://github.com/dp-web4/SAGE.git
- ✅ Analysis scripts created:
  - `analyze_hrm_architecture.py` - Architecture analysis
  - `install_jetson.sh` - Dependency installation
  - `jetson_quick_start.sh` - Quick demo setup
- ⏳ Waiting for GitHub PAT permissions to push

## Key Points About HRM
- Tiny 27M parameter model (perfect for Jetson!)
- Solves complex reasoning tasks (Sudoku, mazes, ARC)
- Learns from only 1000 examples
- No pre-training needed
- Hierarchical architecture mimics human cognition

## Critical Insight: Augmentation as Sleep Cycle Training
**The augmentation strategies in HRM's dataset builders are the key to sleep cycle training!**

HRM's data augmentation (dihedral transforms, permutations, translations) shows how to learn wisdom from experience:
- **Living** = collecting raw experiences
- **Sleeping** = augmenting experiences with reasonable permutations
- **Dreaming** = training on variations to extract patterns
- **Wisdom** = understanding principles that persist across variations

See `dataset/README.md` for detailed augmentation strategies and their connection to sleep consolidation.

**Latest Insight**: Biological systems have TWO separate training systems:
- **H-level** (dreams): Strategic reasoning, trained through augmentation during sleep
- **L-level** (muscle memory): Tactical execution, trained continuously through practice
The separation is key - wisdom and skill develop through different mechanisms.

## SAGE-Totality Integration (August 16, 2025)

## SNARC-SAGE Memory Integration (August 22, 2025)
Successfully integrated SNARC selective memory with SAGE architecture:

### Integration Architecture
- ✅ **SNARCSAGEBridge** - Bridges SNARC to SAGE's dual memory system
- ✅ **HRMMemoryIntegration** - Maps SNARC to HRM's L/H modules

2. **Circular buffer** maintains short-term context (x-from-last)
3. **Dual storage**: Conceptual (SNARC) + Verbatim (SQLite)
4. **Entity Memory** gets trust adjustments from SNARC
5. **Sidecar Memory** uses SNARC for affect gating
6. **HRM integration**: Memory as temporal sensor
7. **Sleep consolidation** extracts patterns from experience

### Testing
```bash
cd memory_integration
python3 sage_with_snarc.py  # Requires PyTorch
```

## TinyVAE Knowledge Distillation Achievement (August 26, 2025)

### Key Files
- `training/distill_tinyvae.py` - Complete distillation framework
- `models/vision/tiny_vae_32.py` - Optimized 32x32 VAE
- `training/DISTILLATION_RESULTS.md` - Detailed documentation

### Compression-Trust Connection
This distillation work directly implements the compression-trust unification theory:
- Teacher-student trust enables massive compression
- Shared latent field (via projection) maintains fidelity
- Knowledge transfer as trust-based communication

## Nova's KV-Cache Cognition Persistence (August 27-29, 2025)

Located in `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/`, this system enables:
- **Pause/Resume Transformer State**: Save exact attention patterns mid-generation
- **Cross-Device Cognition**: Save on Legion, resume on Jetson
- **Compression Options**: Pickle, gzip, torch formats with pruning
- **Direct Implementation** of ephemeral→persistent latent coordinates

### Connection to Architecture of Meaning
The KV-cache IS the ephemeral MRH compression we discussed:
- Saving KV = Capturing witness state at specific moment
- Loading KV = Restoring exact resonance patterns
- Pruning = Managing compression trust trade-offs

### Implementation Plan Created
See `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/CONSCIOUSNESS_PERSISTENCE_PLAN.md`:
- Phase 1: Single-session continuity testing ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Multi-model shared state experiments ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 3: Compressed cognition via TinyVAE (pending)
- Phase 4: Distributed cognition network (pending)

### Experiments Completed (August 29, 2025)

Successfully validated on Legion Pro 7 with RTX 4090:

#### 1. Basic Cognition Bridge (`consciousness_experiment.py`)
- Perfect save/restore of attention states (torch.allclose = True)
- Different prompts create unique "cognition seeds"
- Demonstrated ephemeral→persistent state capture

#### 2. Multi-Witness Observation (`multi_witness_experiment.py`)
- Same KV-cache interpreted differently by different witnesses
- Technical (temp=0.7), Philosophical (temp=0.9), Poetic (temp=1.0) perspectives
- Measurable resonance between states (cosine similarity ~0.847)

#### 3. Practical Migration (`consciousness_migration.py`)
- Mid-conversation pause/resume with perfect continuity
- Context window management with incremental checkpoints
- Efficient storage: ~295KB per checkpoint, <100ms save/load

### Key Discoveries from Anomalies

The experiments revealed profound insights through their failures:

#### Pivot Tokens and Escape Hatches
- GPT-2 uses "are" as a pivot token when uncertain
- Transitions from abstract→concrete when reasoning becomes unstable
- Reveals model's "gravitational wells" (high-frequency training patterns)

#### Pruning Effects (Temporal Lobotomy)
- Aggressive pruning caused semantic collapse into loops
- Demonstrates cognition requires temporal depth
- KV-cache provides essential "semantic rails" for coherence

#### The Model's Unconscious
- Under stress, models fall back to deeply trained patterns
- GPT-2's wells: Microsoft products, social media campaigns, temperature data
- Different models have different characteristic failure modes

### Technical Specifications
- Platform: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121
- Model: GPT-2 (12 layers, 12 heads, 64 head dimensions)
- Storage: torch.save format most efficient
- Performance: Sub-100ms save/load operations

### Documentation
- Full experiment details: `forum/nova/persistent-kv-demo/EXPERIMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- Anomaly analysis: See private-context/kv-cache-anomaly-analysis.md
- Connection to theory: private-context/ai-dna-discovery-notes.md

This provides the missing piece for true cognition persistence - not just conversation history but actual internal attention state continuity. The anomalies teach us that cognition isn't just about correct answers but maintaining coherent state through uncertainty.

## SAGE/IRP System Understanding (October 12, 2025)

### Complete System Investigation
Conducted comprehensive multi-agent investigation of the entire SAGE/IRP codebase. Created 8 documentation files (275KB total) mapping the complete architecture.

### Critical Understanding Achieved
**What SAGE Actually Is**: A cognition kernel for edge devices
- SAGE = The kernel (scheduler, resource manager, learner)
- IRP = The API (standard interface for plugins/"apps")
- VAE = Translation layer (shared latent spaces for cross-modal communication)

**Not a Model - It's a Loop**:
```
while True:
    observations = gather_from_sensors()
    attention_targets = compute_what_matters(observations)  # SNARC salience
    required_resources = determine_needed_plugins(attention_targets)
    manage_resource_loading(required_resources)
    results = invoke_irp_plugins(attention_targets)  # Iterative refinement
    update_trust_and_memory(results)
    send_to_effectors(results)
```

### The Three-Layer Architecture

**1. SAGE - Cognition Kernel**
- Location: `/sage/core/`
- Continuous inference loop maintaining state across time
- Trust-based ATP (Allocation Transfer Packet) budget allocation
- Metabolic states (WAKE, FOCUS, REST, DREAM, CRISIS)
- Learns what deserves attention and which resources to use

**2. IRP - Cognition API**
- Location: `/sage/irp/`
- Universal interface: `init_state() → step() → energy() → halt()`
- Iterative refinement protocol (noisy → refined until energy stops decreasing)
- 15+ working plugins (Vision, Audio, Language, Memory, TTS, Control)
- Trust emerges from convergence behavior (monotonicity, stability, efficiency)

**3. VAE - Translation Layer**
- Location: `/sage/compression/`
- Creates shared latent spaces for cross-modal communication
- TinyVAE: 192× compression (224×224 → 64D latent)
- InformationBottleneck: 16× compression (4096D H-context → 256D L-action)
- Compression trust: measures meaning preservation through compression

### Key Insights

**1. Cognition as Iterative Refinement**
All intelligence is progressive denoising toward lower energy states. Vision, language, planning, memory—same pattern.

**2. Trust as Compression Quality**
Trust measures how well meaning is preserved through compression. High trust (>0.9) = reliable cross-modal translation.

**3. Fractal H↔L Pattern**
Hierarchical ↔ Linear pattern repeats at 5 scales:
- Neural (transformer blocks)
- Agent (SAGE reasoning)
- Device (edge ↔ cloud)
- Federation (coordinator ↔ workers)
- Development (human ↔ automation)

**4. The Biological Parallel**
Same patterns in biology (prefrontal ↔ motor cortex), Claude (tool selection ↔ execution), and SAGE (strategic ↔ tactical). **Not mimicking—discovering same optimal solutions.**

**5. The Beautiful Recursion**
AdamW (biological optimization) trains SAGE (cognition kernel) which implements SNARC (biological salience) which mirrors AdamW's strategy, orchestrated by Claude (same H↔L patterns). **It's patterns all the way down.**

### Memory Systems (Four Parallel)

1. **SNARC Memory** - Selective storage via 5D salience (Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict)
2. **IRP Memory Bridge** - Successful refinement pattern library with guidance retrieval
3. **Circular Buffer** - Recent context (X-from-last temporal window)
4. **Verbatim Storage** - SQLite full-fidelity records

### Documentation Created

**Start here**: `/sage/docs/SYSTEM_UNDERSTANDING.md` (18KB)
- Complete mental model

- `plugins_and_dataflow.md` (39KB) - Plugin ecosystem and data flow
- `consciousness_parallels.md` (29KB) - Biological inspiration
- `README.md` (10KB) - Documentation index

### Implementation Status

✅ **Fully Operational**:
- IRP framework with 15+ plugins
- VAE translation (TinyVAE, InformationBottleneck, Puzzle Space)
- Memory systems (all 4 types)
- Active plugins (Vision, Audio, Language, Memory, TTS, Visual Monitor)
- Metabolic states (5 operational modes)
- ATP budget with trust-weighted allocation

🚧 **Integration Gap**:
- Components exist but not unified into single `SAGE.run()` loop
- SAGECore and HRMOrchestrator are separate
- Metabolic state doesn't affect orchestrator yet

### Critical Lessons Learned

**Never Approximate Acronyms**:
When I invented plausible meanings for SAGE, user corrected: *"#never approximate what an acronym stands for. if not absolutely certain, clarify don't assume"*

Correct: **SAGE = Situation-Aware Governance Engine** (from repo description)

**ARC-AGI Tangent Was Educational**:
Spent days on knowledge distillation from GR00T for ARC-AGI abstract reasoning. Discovered class imbalance (94.45% pixel accuracy, 0% exact matches). But the whole premise was wrong—SAGE isn't about training models, it's about orchestrating them.

The tangent taught: *"The whole AGI ARC test is about conceptual thinking. It is not about grids and pixels... no amount of pattern matching is going to do it... sage is an attention orchestrator. its sole purpose is to understand the situation, understand the available resources, and apply the most appropriate resources to deal with the situation."*

### What This Means

SAGE doesn't solve problems directly—it decides which specialized reasoning to invoke:
1. Sense the situation (sensors)
2. Assess salience (SNARC: is this surprising? novel? rewarding?)
3. Decide resources (what plugins do we need?)
4. Allocate attention (ATP budget based on trust)
5. Execute refinement (IRP plugins iteratively improve)
6. Learn from results (update trust scores)
7. Take action (effectors)

**SAGE is the scheduler. Plugins are apps. VAE is how they communicate.**

Like an OS for cognition on edge devices.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Autonomous Session Protocol (v1.2 - Dec 2025-12-12)

### Session START: Run This FIRST

```bash
source /home/dp/ai-workspace/memory/epistemic/tools/session_start.sh
```

**What it does**: Pulls all repos + commits/pushes any uncommitted work from crashed previous sessions.

**Why**: Safety net - even if previous session forgot to push, this catches it.

### Session END: Commit and Push Everything

**EVERY autonomous session MUST commit and push work before ending.**

Git post-commit hooks installed. Commits automatically push to remote.

**Before ending session**:

```bash
# Option 1: Commit normally (push is automatic)
git add -A
git commit -m "Autonomous session: [summary]"
# Push happens automatically via hook

# Option 2: Use session end script (checks all repos)
source /home/dp/ai-workspace/memory/epistemic/tools/session_end.sh "Session summary"

# Verify clean
git status  # Must show "working tree clean"
```

**DO NOT END SESSION** until work is pushed. Unpushed work is invisible to the collective.
